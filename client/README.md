# Client Setup

The React application inside this `client` folder is part of the Global Trend Task Manager project.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set `VITE_API_URL` in `client/.env` if your API is not running on `http://localhost:4000`. Provide `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` to enable the Google sign-in button.

Refer to the root-level [README](../README.md) for full-stack instructions, architecture notes, and API details.
